About the sailboat and the tides and the dusk and the stars .
I was a captive and a slave .
I say to the boy .
I am the icing to the cake .
I returned to the saloon .
I skipped to the postscript .
I went to the house .
I have to go to a party .
I went to the movies .
Listen to the word of the Lord .
I tried to explain the dangers of the streets .
I am the king of the Blefuscians !
The life of a man and the life of a thing .
I was in a bit of a hurry .
I was fifteen and a half .
I was a Transient .
I was the first to address the situation .
I was the star .
I was referring to the corpses .
I was a ballerina .
I was homesick and I missed the dogs .
I was a steward .
It had a scissors and a corkscrew and a fingernail clipper and a screwdriver .
Tending to the poor and then to him .
All the way to the left and up .
What about the Mackeys and the Abercrombies and the Schermerhorns ?
I wish to God I had .
I had a boat .
I had to laugh .
I had to be the best .
I had a lot of motivation .
I leave in the morning .
I got a plane to catch in the morning .
I look in the backseat .
I started to craft a node to plant in the Skein .
I live in the garage .
I plopped in a chair and slumped .
Dressed in the clothes of the hunters .
I will in a moment .
I 'm in a nutshell !
Right in the middle of the night .
I felt like I was living in the middle of a minefield .
Want to go to the beach ?
I was a lousy bouncer .
I was in a trance during the best parts .
How was I to know ?
That was the way of the world .
It was a hell of a morning to be driving to the Moon .
The tear in the muscle was the size of a nut .
I was about to float .
I was on a roll .
I was the Head Prefect .
I was n't planning to .
I doubted that the man I was speaking to was Jonah .
He was a friend of a friend .
I was beginning to think th was nobody in .
I was n't going to .
That was the time of the wedding .
I was coming to ski .
I was visiting a friend .
He was in the middle of a vast hive .
It was a blow to the head .
I was invited to attend .
I was desperate to get back to the surface .
I thought I was fine .
Most of the liturgy was in Ukrainian .
I was n't involved in any of the bombings .
I was glad to oblige .
I was n't sure I was .
I was talking to you !
All to the good .
Go to the left .
Easy to talk to .
He fled to the back of the house .
Get to the point .
Take the bitch to the truck !
Welcome to the neighborhood .
Back to the beginning .
Back to the beginning .
Back to the sentence .
Back to the Loup-garou .
I'm--going to the movies .
Surrendered to the Dictator .
I said I could .
I want to be a frog !
I want to be a frog !
I got up and opened the door to the balcony .
I was n't a friend of Mitch 's .
I have to go !
I have a kamebara .
I have a machine-for the snow .
I have to go .
I have a spare .
I have a son !
I have to go to orchestra .
I have a boyfriend .
I have a favor to ask .
I have a lead .
I think I want out of the story .
I do the same .
I know I would .
I like to call the shots .
I suppose I did .
I had to tell the doctors to go in and get her .
I see that someone was a fan of the past .
Once he was a friend of the workers .
It was and he was n't ?
I was married in 1929 and he died in 1932 .
I thought it was a raccoon .
I thought it was a football .
I think it was a moose .
I thought it was a thunderbolt .
I went back to the kitchen .
I went back and forth to the bodega .
It was a man speaking to her in the dream .
I was fucking her .
I stepped back and examined the front of the house .
I rushed to the bar and looked over .
I rolled over to the mirror .
I want to know .
I know the feeling .
I 'll get to you in a minute .
Marlena rolled to the end of the stage and took the ramp down to the floor .
And of the children .
And the essence of the atom ?
It 's the end of the world .
It 's the pattern of the deathdays .
I was the world 's welterweight champion of the silent feud .
Anna 's a sculptor and a musician !
That 's the number of the card .
It 's in the Book of Genesis .
I 'm a rebel .
I 'm going to the hospital .
I 'm going to the hospital .
I 'm a plodder .
I 'm a frog .
I 'm a businessman .
I 'm the last to preach .
I 'm a freak !
I 'm headed to the warehouse .
I 'm to blame .
I 'm a postnasciturus .
I get to record the results .
They went to the remains of the house .
Instead I 'm the center of the universe .
I 'm the top of the heap now .
I killed a man .
Be a man of the will .
I got a plan .
I wanted to say .
I say to Savo .
I think of dreaming .
I made the call .
I never kept a tally of the girls I fucked .
I want a Biro .
I want to dig a basement .
I wanted to close the door .
I thought of Molly .
I liked the house .
I wish I knew .
I look to Savo .
I left a message .
I took a walk .
I took a lot of names and numbers .
Everything but the dishes and the steaks I had in the freezer .
I 've seen the looks I get on the street and in the stores .
That 's a nose and that 's eyes and that 's a mouth there .
I saw the news .
I wanted to scream .
I wanted to run .
I wanted to hide .
I loathe the place .
I talked to a big thinker .
I need a change .
I need the edge .
I love the hair .
That 's the kind of man he was .
I tried to call .
I love to study .
I love the cabin .
I needed a phone .
I was n't fit to be a wife .
I was n't bitching .
I was n't either !
I was n't snoring .
I was n't aware .
I was n't afraid of the people I lived beside .
That 's the truth of it .
I give the guy the once-over .
I heard a clank of chains .
I sing along to the music .
I am a god .
I used to hunt .
I followed the sound .
Not to speak of .
I drank a glass of water .
All of the above .
I held the pistol .
I nod and try to smile .
Because of the children .
I cut the lawn .
Understatement of the year .
I decided to change the subject .
I shot the gun .
I pointed to the Jacksonville paper .
I ordered a drink .
I became the uncle .
I dropped the ax .
I pinged the box .
I changed the subject .
I showed the journal to Steve .
I reached the intersection of Aldrin and Main .
I missed the boyfriend .
I pressed the switch .
I fail to follow .
I was on the edge again .
Nick was on the phone to the school in seconds .
I circle the block .
I checked the date .
Out of the question .
I recognize the style .
I counted the digits .
Because of a horse ?
Have a view of the sea ?
I breast-fed a hippo .
Only the rattle of a matchbook .
I ordered a bottle of wine .
I wish to God she was .
Perhaps she was fleeing in the direction of the voice of Father .
It was two in the morning and she was the only one in the surgical suite .
Part of the service !
Scarcely a quarter the price of a Dulux .
Son of a bitch !
Son of a bitch .
Think of the metaphor .
Careful of the gusher .
I was n't that drunk .
I 'll see to that .
Tell that to the lawyers .
I decided I was going to talk to her about that .
What a sight that was !
I think that 's the hardest part .
Aware that I was there and that I 'd be leaving .
I think that 's right .
There was a chance that I had cancer of the cervix .
And that was that .
So that was the way it was to be .
All that was missing was a conservatory .
I call that a commitment .
Not that I know of .
There was comfort in that .
I was born that way .
I never thought of that .
I was n't that much a part of it .
I have to fix that .
I always was one hell of a teacher-not that the schools appreciated that .
Or was that twitch because of the Parkinson 's ?
I take comfort in that .
I know the lake was glowing with the reflection of the sunset .
It 's that he 's obsessed .
And that was it .
It was only afterwards that the doctors explained to the relatives that it was a stroke .
You said that because he 's in a wheelchair .
I thought he was done .
But he was the eldest .
I knew he was right .
But he was a major shareholder in the company that owned the company that held the deed .
I know he was a good man .
So the stranger was an it and he was n't ?
I was a sucker for bullies .
I was a runner once in high school and for a while in college .
I was in charge of preparing them for the SAT .
She 's out of it .
I 'm sick of it .
I 'm sure of it .
First I heard of it .
I 'm the first to admit it .
But it was a factor .
I 'm sure of it .
It 's coming and it 's triumphing !
That was all there was to it .
But it 's on the edge of the best lake in the world .
So it 's mine and I 'm going to use it .
But it 's going to .
So it was a vigil .
Not a hint of red in it .
I threw it in the trash can .
But it was in Dusseldorf .
I guess I was a little shy about it .
I want to believe it .
Bring it to the meeting .
I was glad I knew which house it was .
I pulled out a card and realized as I handed it to him that it was the wrong one .
I hoped to hell that Bluxome Street was where I thought it was .
I think I broke it .
I picked it up and shined it in Kohl 's face .
I try not to listen to it .
I hope it 's a good day .
I guess that 's what it 's all about .
Because it 's a fiddle to serve .
Maybe he 's stolen it .
I 'm sick of it !
Or maybe it was n't that I was attracting that which I was going through .
I hope it was okay that I read it .
There ... that was it .
I noticed it when I was cleaning .
I 'm sure of it .
But that 's just it .
Not that it was going to be restful now that he was there .
I kind of like it .
Not that it was a big deal .
That 's the way it 's done in Treadstone .
He was sure it was .
I wondered why he had it if he was n't puffing tobacco in and out of it .
I hate to say it .
I want to destroy it .
He was amazing at it and the film was a hit .
Then there was silence in the room and it was terrifying .
I process none of it .
There was a fierceness to her face that was unnerving .
I cleared her plate and took it to the sink .
I want her to have it .
I smile at the face in the mirror .
Maggot walked to the fountain in the wall at the end of the pool .
I want to speak to her alone .
I know it 's hard for her .
Once he locked her in .
He was admitting he was her father .
We have to leave it to her .
I had to watch her .
I found a nickel in one of the bottom drawers of her dresser .
So of course I lied to her .
Not that I 'd ever mention it to her .
I turned to face her .
The shape of her hips and the smell of her neck I want to lose myself in .
I unwrap it for her .
Now I was earning her .
I have it on tapes of her grousing in her cell .
I handed her the comb .
There was a question in her eyes .
I lost interest in her .
Because it was her contribution .
Ann was the darling of her eye .
I called her in and told her what I needed .
And could I give it to her ?
I pulled her to me and held her .
Is he kind to her ?
There 's a portrait of her at Croy in the dining-room .
There 's nothing of her .
I met her in London .
He puts it on the fork and offers it to her .
Y'all owe it to her to tell her .
I made the mistake of trying to reassure her that I knew what I was doing and used the word condom .
I was figurin on a hell of a lot more time to talk her out of it .
She felt the sawdust on the side of her face and in her hair as he pulled her legs open and slid her to the edge of the cabinets .
Now it was her turn to sacrifice .
Maybe it was her imagination .
I want her to pay .
I bought it for her in a used bookstore in Boulder .
I hear the strain in her voice .
Should he lie to her ?
I hear the fear in her voice .
He riffled to the 104SD forms in the center of the booklet .
He motioned in the direction of the lake .
This was his way of revealing that he was gay .
But it was his face that was shocking .
I promised you that .
But that was you .
I told you that .
I told you he was good .
He was a stranger .
He was a dressmaker .
He was seated in a wheelchair .
He was a professional .
He was a notorious boss of the Philadelphia mob in the forties and fifties .
He was a ghost .
He was glued to the spot .
He was carrying a bucket and a trowel .
The statue was of a woman .
The eunuch was the master of the house .
The bar was in a cellar .
The cause of death was a blow to the head .
I told you that it was the one thing that I would n't do .
Rachel it 's you .
Marley 's mother had fallen and was in the hospital .
I think she 's a nun in disguise .
I think she 's still in the supermarket .
I wave him in .
I used to go to his workout .
I know it from the sound of his slippers and of his grumbling about the long lines .
I suspect it 's his way of doing things .
In his bathrobe he showed her to the door .
It was a prize in one of his tournaments .
// I think that was his pseudonym .
She saw his answer in his eyes and felt it in his pants .
I talked to Willoughby in his store in Portland .
Appropriating-that was the story of his life .
I was n't really that surprised .
I was n't going to let that happen .
I did n't even have to go in to see that he was dying .
I was n't sure if he was a butler or a friend .
Actually he was n't .
I have the best chef in the world .
After that it was n't important .
I wo n't dismiss it and say it was nonsense .
But it was n't that cold .
I was n't playing with it .
That was n't it .
There was n't much to it .
I did n't see it in the newspaper .
But tonight he was n't going to make it to the Bucket .
And it 's not that I do n't want it .
I did n't realize it was Sheila 's .
I was thinking of trying to get in touch with you .
But you started in saying that he 's dying .
I see you when I go to the supermarket .
They said it was a pleasure to teach you .
I never meant to deny you that .
I 'm proud of you .
I 'll explain it to you later .
Is it not a fact that he was infatuated with you ?
What was it you were speaking of ?
I expected more of you .
I want you to go .
Do you think it 's the ghost ?
Who 's asking you to ?
And he suggested that I call you .
Would you take her to the cabin ?
I 've put you in the guest-house .
What do you think it was he asked her ?
I wanted to get you out of the way .
Are you in the office ?
I 'll take you in the car .
Get you a spot in a show ?
I 'm sick of you .
What I do to you ?
I asked you a question .
I came home to you .
Do you talk like that in front of her ?
I was very glad to see you .
Was that you that borrowed the convertible ?
May I remind you that I pay you to assist me .
Let it talk to you .
That 's sweet of you .
I thought you was goin to sleep .
I wanted to see you .
What I 's ever ask of you ?
I 'll text you the address and the time .
May I call you that ?
I 'm nice to you .
Did I tell you that ?
I knew you took it !
Are you the keeper of the Excalibur ?
I wish you the best of luck .
I worked on that .
I told him I was tired .
I did n't tell her who I was .
It was n't that she did n't care ; it was simply that it was hard for her to take the initiative in a situation that was n't her business .
I was n't trying to call her name .
This was the cabin he had built in the summers of 1980 and 1981 .
I 've had it .
I was supposed to be writing a dissertation .
She was engulfed in a wave of desolation .
She was a client .
She was a fraud .
She was thinking of the limp .
I was bleeding out .
I told her a long time ago that I had a daughter .
She fell backward and I was on top of her .
I like to call her on it when I can .
Gone on a journey and her cavorting in the master 's bed .
. like the wind in a meadow .
It was hard to tell she was in her seventies .
Everything she found was a treasure to her .
I looked from her to the mic she held in her hand .
Am I in one of the PU spaces ?
So what was I to do ?
What was I going to do .
What was I going to do .
What was I going to do .
It was a joke .
It was a tavern .
It was all of a sudden .
It was a relief to crumb the table .
It was a problem .
It was a shadow .
It was a park .
It was a truth of sorts .
It was the chimney .
It was a mystery .
It was a weekday .
It was two-thirty in the morning .
It was a dream I was glad to leave unfinished .
It was down to the wire .
It was a fork .
It was a party .
It was deliberate in the intention .
It was a trend .
It was a thing .
I was real familiar with it .
There was a family in the car : the Morrisons .
He 's the thief !
He 's grown a ponytail and a beard .
He 's in Texas .
He 's in jail .
He 's fraid of the dark .
He 's in advertising .
He 's a businessman .
He 's a bear .
He 's a Chinaman .
He 's a bear .
The picture was a closeup of the victim 's face .
The back-up 's in the firewall .
Ai n't you going to wear that to the canvass ?
I assume you have n't heard of it .
I did n't tell you that .
I ca n't talk to you .
I walked down to the site of the accident and examined it for myself .
I reach for it .
This was one of the advantages of age .
Change in the back .
Maybe it was something you had to be born to .
I simply had to see you .
I had no right even to mention it to you .
I 'll knock a hole in the wall if I want to .
I told you she was beautiful .
I was too dense to know what I was doing .
But the people in the corridors ?
Tal was in both of them .
I was so depressed .
I was so excited .
I was so early .
There was a woman sitting by the stove in the middle of the room .
And in the process I learned a lot .
Then he pushed her to the bottom with his feet .
He was a Communist and I used to sleep with his sister .
I was the only woman there .
I was susceptible at that age .
Not with the likes of you !
I 'm with you .
I was n't aware of the exact nature of the position when I brought it up the other day .
I do n't blame you .
He was n't even in the picture .
I got that card and I could n't believe it -- the Congo .
I knew you would n't .
I just want you to know it was n't your fault .
I do n't think that .
I said you ca n't do it !
Do n't you see it ?
I do n't get that .
I do n't get it .
I did n't know what it was .
I did n't want you to throw it away .
I have n't seen it .
I did n't dare leave the neighborhood in it .
I do n't believe that !
Oh you do n't know the half of it .
It was n't until I sat down to write it that I realized that it did n't amount to much of anything .
I did n't think that what I did was that important .
But I was n't overdrugged .
I was n't sure whether it was good news .
I ca n't tell you .
I did n't do it .
Is n't it a pain in the neck to roll the bleached cotton ?
But was n't that just part of the mystery ?
I could n't remember what it was I did n't like about her .
I do n't believe it .
Ca n't tell her that .
Diane was n't like that .
I do n't get it .
That was n't the bet .
But it was n't Lester .
Lorenzo said he was glad he was married ; Mason was glad he was n't .
I ca n't stop you .
I promise I wo n't .
I ca n't stand it !
I do n't get it .
I did n't say I would n't hogtie you and throw you in the boat .
I did n't want it to stop .
Did n't you hear that ?
Would n't he want to be part of it ?
I was n't buying any .
I did n't need her to tell me that .
I could n't believe it .
Do n't he give you the creeps ?
Her husband was there was n't he ?
I could n't do it .
But I do n't like to think of you doing it .
I could n't tell you .
I do n't fear it .
I ca n't believe it .
I do n't want to go to his place .
I do n't want to see it .
It was n't Claudia 's .
I always knew it was n't cancer .
It was n't worth it .
I ca n't meet you !
Did n't he get it ?
I could n't place her .
I was certain she was n't old-fashioned .
I did n't want to ride behind her and scare her .
Because a lover was n't a client .
I was n't handling the hostility well .
I 'm sorry that I ca n't help you .
I thought you did n't believe in that sort of thing .
I did n't want to .
Tonight I was n't invited .
I was surprised that I had n't noticed how attractive he was the night I visited Reiter .
I do n't remember it .
I ca n't think of anything that 's missing .
I did n't need to .
I was n't going to get a second chance .
I ai n't touched her .
I ca n't believe you want that .
I was n't about to put up with that .
I do n't like her .
I did n't mean that .
I do n't think p211 that Lucilla 's ever stayed in a hotel in the whole of her life .
I ca n't believe it .
I was n't here at the time .
I could n't bear to accept that it was all over .
I ca n't do that .
I wo n't do it !
I told him that it was the one thing I would n't do .
I do n't believe it !
That 's why I did n't know it was you who was coming .
I did n't tell you ?
The fact of the matter was I did n't trust her .
But I was n't busy .
That 's why I do n't want you to go to that store .
I did n't say that .
I have n't the time .
I hoped it did n't .
It was n't a dictionary .
I did n't want that .
Do n't you think I know that ?
Pain was n't a guide .
I did n't want to do that .
He was n't the first .
Do n't you remember what a pro I was !
I was n't Xan 's type either .
Maybe that was n't helpful .
She was n't his mother .
I do n't believe I said that .
But it was n't possible .
I was n't paying that much attention .
I did n't say that .
I was n't very worried .
I do n't think that .
I do n't know why he thought I was a vegetarian .
I did n't mind it .
She was naive like that and you could n't change her .
I ca n't believe it .
And was n't it the unknown that was supposed to be so enticing ?
I do n't get it .
I do n't like it .
Even then you did n't have it in you .
I ca n't do it .
I could n't blame her .
I said I ca n't .
I do n't mean it in a nasty way .
I had n't anticipated that !
It was n't that kind of camp .
I did n't mean to scare you .
I do n't believe that .
I 'm in radio .
I 'm in London .
I 'm in the southeast stairwell .
I 'm in quite a lot of pain .
I 'm in here !
I 'm getting in .
Can I get in ?
He was that quick .
I know I was beginning to feel overwhelmed .
We arrived in Yarmouth in the midst of a celebration .
He says he 's a reporter .
He 's only thirty and he 's able to drive a car .
He was always kinder to the waitress than he was to me .
But I was curious .
But Moretti was a son of a bitch .
I have a surprise for you .
I have a surprise for you .
I apologized for you .
I want you to know I am praying for you .
I 'll get it for you .
It 's for you .
I have a proposition for you .
I saved it just for you .
I was just funnin .
I decide to take that as a compliment .
He was so proud of it that he combed it every morning .
He held it to the light .
He loves to watch it in the dark .
He 's apt to resist it .
The town was proud of it .
The relief of it .
I was married to your father .
I smile at her .
I waved at her .
I 'll sleep in the bathroom .
I had n't understood .
I would n't confess to something I had n't done .
She hoped and prayed that it was n't a gun Matt had put in his locker .
I wished I had n't come .
I had the feeling as he left that I was n't going to get rid of Kevin Doyle that easily .
I had n't grooved like that in years .
I had n't noticed it before .
I had n't expected him to say that .
I do n't want it to fall on the floor .
I did n't mean to put her on the spot .
I ca n't have her on a sofa .
That was lost in the mists of time .
She 's a babysitter .
She 's a fake !
She 's a saint .
She 's a cow .
She 's a washer-up .
She 's frozen to the spot .
She 's a woman .
She 's in pain .
She 's the best .
He wants to take her and grip her and make her scream .
He realizes he 's way ahead of her .
But she was n't .
I requested something to puke in .
I stand still in the room .
I had the VW microbus .
All you had to do was swallow .
Why had n't it hit ?
I thought you had fun with her .
I already had a lot of beer .
I really had that coming .
Kenny had tried to get out of the truck but he had n't made it .
But he had to go to work .
He had a flashlight in his hands .
That 's why I had to come. ?
I had to see him .
I was sure that I could pass a polygraph test about just what I had and had n't done .
Benny had had a heart attack and was in the hospital .
I had poems that I had written over the years .
She had to find out what it was that Matt had put in his locker .
I had misjudged the scale .
I had to remind myself .
But maybe he had n't .
I knew I had to do something .
He had to put the baby 's formula in her bottle .
I had the strangest feeling .
I had a tarp in my boat and soon wrapped her with it .
I had had no part in any of the preparation .
I had a pet tiger .
I knew then that I had just had a glimpse of the greatest sorrow that there is .
You had such a career in front of you .
I cried for the blood and the death I had seen .
Paracelsus had the mind of the landlocked .
And it occurred to me that in a way Aless had become the brother I never had .
My first thought was that I had had a stroke .
The voice had a sharpness to it .
And I understand that you had something to do with it .
I had n't seen it around here .
He had a camera and he was hoping to get pictures .
Does n't look like he had to .
But the worst thing I had to face was n't the physical pain .
Vi had it hanging in her bedroom .
I had n't actually thought about it .
All of it had vanished .
I had tried that already .
And he had to go .
Yet I had to let her go .
I had access to the required equipment and that group had access to the required funding .
Then he had divorced her and left .
I had to be sharp .
I had to get out of here .
Man had a right to do it .
He was one of the few who had n't left her a message .
I just had a thought .
Perhaps his father had had a stroke .
I also had a hunch about that .
But you had the problem before that .
I still had n't seen his face .
I want to plant a tree in the living room .
He had wanted to and he had nearly done it .
I think it is .
The snow was shaded and had a glaze on it .
James had had a gin and tonic on the plane .
I went to a restaurant and they had them on the menu .
Marty had said that the night the two of them had first made out in Ben 's car and Jamie had n't understood that her necklace was caught on a rip in the upholstery .
Are you on the nod ?
Tune in on that energy .
I 'm sorry I jumped on you .
She had her blindfold on .
Shatlow was on his feet .
I placed the jar on the floor .
I thought of a class that I had taken the previous semester on peace rites .
He drove to work on his deathday and was killed in a crash .
I was on the lookout for Tara .
I could see a tiny white speck on the ceiling that I assumed was her .
I got lost on the way to the theater .
There was a tap on the door .
X takes a wrench and hangs it on the hood of the car .
I 've had a lot going on .
That 's on the Moon .
Mason prayed on his knees and held on to his bunk .
I have the music on .
I was on the verge of sleep when I thought I heard a tap on the living room window .
There was a smile on her face .
But because it 's on the ocean the salt and the moisture work on it .
I think a house on the ocean 's a good thing .
I figured that he 'd slipped and gone on a drunk .
I 'll call you back on that .
It was one of the things he was thinking of putting on his Christmas list .
I 'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately .
What 's on that piece of paper ?
That 's when he used his fist on her .
It was the play of the moon 's radiance on the dull metal of a knife blade .
She had a mole on her cheek .
I do n't have to put on a show .
He was on his back .
I tell him that I heard about it on the radio .
I 'm on the job .
I turned on the light .
That he had never cheated on her .
I think of the march on the Pentagon and trying to break the line of police and National Guardsmen .
I do n't want to face what 's on the other side of the door .
Daddy 's on the floor .
I 'm working on it .
I heard he was working on a cruise ship .
I have to spy on you bastards in the head to get the inside scoop on anything .
I recognized the look on his face .
I had seen it on my realtor .
Then I looked in the mirror .
I rolled in after .
May I come in ?
I leave the house in search of Dave .
Here was a life she had n't lived .
It was n't the first time she had borne the marks of his anger .
Should I look in the books ?
I drained my cup and tossed it in the trash .
I touched my cheek and discovered that I 'd cut it in the fall .
What was the name ?
What was I thinking ?
And she 's cashing in on the loot .
With that she spun on her heel and stalked to the door .
It 's the last thing in the world I want to do .
I left the Volvo in a red zone .
One was old and the other was young .
I asked in surprise .
It 's a seed !
It 's a question of degree .
It 's a quarter to four .
It 's a disaster .
It 's just a matter of a second .
It 's a second .
It 's a reflex .
It 's the best part of the job .
It 's the pits .
It 's going to a children 's museum .
It 's a deal .
It 's the truth .
It 's a song .
It was Kohl 's .
It 's in the bottom oven .
It 's a mess .
It 's a mess .
It 's in the Delaware Trust .
It 's a question .
It 's one of the oldest tactics in the book .
It 's a mystery .
It 's quarter to .
It 's the truth .
It 's a dog .
It 's a wolf .
It 's a plane !
It 's a group .
It 's Dobbs 's .
It 's a balance .
I was too distracted .
I was too weak .
I thought I was going to go insane .
Like she had n't aged a day .
If only she had retreated to the kitchen before he had spotted her !
And she had to get in her Carl and Maizie story .
Could n't you see she was upset ?
I realized she was not my sister and that you had sold me .
I think she did it on purpose .
She wished she had n't mentioned it .
Then one of the waitresses came up to tell her she was wanted in the kitchen and she was gone .
And she had a name .
She thought she was used to it .
It 's your fault that she 's in there !
She was just sexually deprived and she loved to bask in the scent of the man of her fantasies .
I fancied for a moment that she was that handsome woman .
Do you think she 's on something ?
All the way to Molly 's school I told myself that she was n't in danger yet .
Do n't you think she 's beautiful ?
And he was nothing to her but a man she desired .
There was a day in the airport she remembered .
I assured her she 'd get used to it .
Now she 's closer to her shelter .
I could hear that she was high on something and still she had called .
Then she had both of her babies .
I told her she had my permission .
She said she spoke to you on the phone .
I ca n't argue with that .
There was a hardness to his voice I could n't crack with a joke .
That was the deal ?
That was the deal .
That was displeasing to the ear .
That was in 1940 .
That was the joke .
I put in details .
I wish I was never artificially created in a lab .
I ask her to come to my office .
There was still enough that was beautiful about her that he was sometimes at a loss and got tangled in his words .
As in the beef ?
Mam and Dad said that he and Fran were sure to make a go of it .
There was the sound of Father in the air again .
You said it was a matter of life and death .
That was the thing that got to me .
I heard sirens in the distance .
There was a silence .
There was silence in the kitchen .
There was a silence .
There was a silence .
There was a silence .
There was a pause .
There was the smell of face-powder and eau-de-cologne .
There was a lot of gold .
There was a teeming of sexes .
There was a moment of silence .
That 's what I like in a chauffeur-subtlety .
I stopped in front of the metal detector .
Not in the least .
He 's interested in all the families in his congregation .
He 's gangster clean and pressed and it 's there in his body movements and eyes .
He pulls his .45 and checks that there 's a round in the chamber .
He knew that his buyer was going to take it .
He was in pain because of his father .
He was now in his thoughts .
The hand reminded her of his .
The smell of the sea in his hair .
I have n't thought of her for years .
Odd that he was n't going in-house for the job .
I do n't know ; that 's a question for the scientists and philosophers .
I know I was n't the first schmuck in history to fall for his best friend 's girl .
I would n't stop you for the world .
I do n't think that 's for me .
I was n't looking for fish .
He was n't ready for that .
Surely he was n't offering for her hand .
I 'm sitting at the bar and I walk over to you .
I sat down in one of the captain 's chairs .
I am the luckiest girl in the Adirondacks !
All I did was make a call and explain that to him .
He had his problems with the IRS and lost it .
When the town gave it to me I thought it was just a toy .
Give it to me .
Bring it to me .
After that it was just me and Mom .
But I fell in love with her on a day I saw her at the cafeteria .
Between her and Gladys there was a low table with a box of Kleenex on it .
Something 's going on with her .
Yet he wore a baseball cap with the silhouette of a tractor on it .
Kyle put his smartphone on the armrest of his chair and covered it with his palm .
I knew I was being played .
I pull in close .
I believe in labor .
He 's very fond of you .
He 's most adamant that he wants you to continue .
I was told why .
Aside from that I was fine .
I could write in the mornings before I go to Spenlow 's .
This was a matter of PR .
I live in B-63 .
I gave it back to him .
Am I in a PU space ?
That she and the deputy had been friends ; that the deputy had died with his head in her lap .
Then I was ready to return to the rehearsal studio .
His map was of the best .
Like a sunset in a mirror .
I hug her up to me .
I 've had it for a long time .
I had to give him credit for that .
Sid handed the exams in to the teacher .
Get in the trunk .
I ca n't say I was doing so well that I could be the person for her to lean on .
And you know as well as I that that 's a lie .
It 's a relief from it .
Strong in the Lord .
I gasped in pleasure .
I moaned in pleasure .
Back in a sec .
Back in a sec .
Wait in the lobby .
Toss in a match ?
Up in the mountains .
Send in the soldiers !
She was happy he was brilliant .
Like I once was .
Why the devil was he bringing that up ?
I climbed up a couple of the steps to get the candy he offered .
